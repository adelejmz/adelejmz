# 👋 Hi, I'm Adele Jamalzei
**PhD Student in Plant Breeding & Genetics | Washington State University**

I am a researcher dedicated to increasing global wheat yield through the intersection of **Genetics**, **Plant Breeding**, and **Data Science**. My work focuses on identifying and introgressing quantitative trait loci (QTLs) to boost wheat production.

## 🛠 Technical Expertise
* **High-Throughput Phenotyping (HTP):** Experienced in analyzing large-scale phenotypic datasets, specifically processing canopy cover temporal data derived from drone imagery to track crop development.
* **Statistical Modeling:** Expert in fitting Linear Mixed Models (MLM) for GxE interactions and Generalized Linear Models (GLM) using Gamma distributions for non-normal biological traits.
* **Phenology Analysis:** Developed custom R pipelines to estimate biological breakpoints (dormancy and canopy closure) using non-linear logistic growth curves.
* **Climate Analytics:** Built Python tools (Pandas/Matplotlib) to calculate Growing Degree Days (GDD) and aggregate meteorological trends from raw weather station data.
* **Data Engineering:** Experienced in creating automated pre-analysis pipelines for multi-location trial validation and data integrity checks.

## 🔬 Research Focus
* **QTL Introgression:** Introgressing yield-related QTLs to optimize wheat performance across diverse genetic backgrounds.
* **Drone Image Analytics:** Leveraging high-throughput temporal data to quantify phenotypic plasticity and developmental milestones.
* **Genotype-by-Environment (GxE):** Analyzing phenotypic plasticity across environments using advanced visualization like `ggtext` and `ggnewscale`.
* **GWAS:** Identifying genetic markers associated with key yield components.

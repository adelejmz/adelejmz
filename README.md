# 👋 Hi, I'm Adele Jamalzei
**PhD Student in Plant Breeding & Genetics | Washington State University**

I am a researcher dedicated to increasing global wheat yield through the intersection of **Genetics**, **Plant Breeding**, and **Data Science**. My work focuses on identifying and introgressing quantitative trait loci (QTLs) to boost wheat production.

## 🛠 Technical Expertise
* **High-Throughput Phenotyping (HTP)
* **Statistical Modeling
* **Phenology Analysis
* **Climate Analytics:
* **Data Engineering:

## 🔬 Research Focus
* **QTL Introgression:** Introgressing yield-related QTLs to optimize wheat performance across diverse genetic backgrounds.
* **Drone Image Analytics:** Leveraging high-throughput temporal data to quantify phenotypic plasticity and developmental milestones.
* **Genotype-by-Environment (GxE):** Analyzing phenotypic plasticity across environments.
* **GWAS:** Identifying genetic markers associated with key yield components.

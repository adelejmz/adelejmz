# 👋 Hi, I'm Adele Jamalzei 🌾

**PhD Student in Plant Breeding & Genetics | Washington State University** 🐾

I am a researcher dedicated to increasing global wheat yield through the intersection of **Genetics**, **Plant Breeding**, and **Data Science**. My work focuses on identifying and introgressing quantitative trait loci (QTLs) to boost wheat production. 🚀

## 🛠️ Technical Expertise
* **🛰️ High-Throughput Phenotyping (HTP)
* **📊 Statistical Modeling
* **🌱 Phenology Analysis
* **🌡️ Climate Analytics
* **⚙️ Data Engineering

## 🔬 Research Focus
* **🧬 QTL Introgression:** Introgressing yield-related QTLs to optimize wheat performance across diverse genetic backgrounds.
* **🚁 Drone Image Analytics:** Leveraging high-throughput temporal data to quantify phenotypic plasticity and developmental milestones.
* **🌍 Genotype-by-Environment (GxE):** Analyzing phenotypic plasticity across diverse environments to improve crop resilience.
* **🔍 GWAS:** Identifying genetic markers associated with key yield components to accelerate breeding cycles.
